### 经历/Experiences

2017年接触前端开发，使用腾讯云架设过个人网站。

2018年研究生入学，研究方向是区块链，使用Node.js实现过Secp256k1的加法，环签名等。

2019年加入Monero中国社区，参与翻译了《精通门罗币》。暑期在加拿大卑诗省期间初步完成了一个Node.js的P2P工具，回国之后形成了一个npm包(Beautiful_p2p)。

2020年参与京东实习、阿里巴巴暑期实习，获得阿里巴巴转正offer。工作描述：在阿里巴巴飞猪技术部行业与平台前端组工作期间，实现和部署了手机淘宝-飞猪的NPS反馈系统。从数据库表设计开始，后端使用nodejs(midway.js)，前端为手淘组件，完成了设计稿像素级还原，最后进行部署和灰度发布，单人编码完成全过程。

2021年加入新加坡Shopee，担任前端开发一职。工作使用全英文，组长为印尼人, 组员来自多国。岗位职责为开发与维护内部系统。例如：1.部署可缩放的树状节点图，根据后端传递的数组信息重建树的结构，并以此为数据源使用react-flow-render与dagre绘制树状图 2.可以编辑的前端表格，能够计算数据的更改并回传。

2022年继续在Shopee新加坡工作；工作内容包括对开源方案进行定制化，利用Autodesk react-table-base 与useInfiniteQuery定制了无限滚动的表格；使用docker建立用于部署的image并替换旧image实现环境的升级；使用Sentry对前端页面进行监控，设置警报. 使用Playwright部署自动化回归测试。

Year 2017: Begin to learn about Front End Development. Built a personal website with Tencent cloud service.

The year 2018: Enrolled at Hangzhou Normal University in pursuit of a master's degree in software engineering. Studied cryptocurrencies especially Monero and Bitcoin. Learned about cryptography. Implemented some cryptography algorithms such as addition on secp256k1 group and ring signature.

The year 2019: Joint the Chinese Monero society participated in the translation of *Mastering Monero: The Future of Private Transactions* to Chinese. Finished a peer-to-peer module with Node.js while staying in Victoria BC. Canada, and published it via NPM after returning to China.

The year 2020: Had two intern jobs as a front-end developer, and worked for JD.com and Alibaba Group. Got a return offer from Alibaba group. When working for Alibaba - fliggy, I build the NPS system for fliggy on Taobao mobile Apps. I started by designing the database chart structures, then built the backend part with node.js and a framework named Midway.js. The front-end part was done with react because this part is webview. I also finished the deployment.

The year 2021: Joined Shopee Singapore as a front-end developer. Worked in a fully English environment, with most teammates from 4 countries and a team leader from Indonesia. Job responsibilities include developing and maintaining the front-end part of several internal web systems. Two examples of what I delivered: 1. A scalable Treeview diagram built with react-flow-render and dagre. It rebuilds the node tree structure from the node array provided by the backend and uses it as the data resource. 2. An editable chart compares dirty local data with source data and sends the changes to the backend.

The year 2022: Continue working in Shopee Singapore. Start learning  about flutter. A few things I did include 1. customizing an infinite scroll chart with Autodesk react-table-base and TanStack Query useInfiniteQuery. 2. Build a new Docker image and replace the old one for upgrading the deployment environment. 3. Use Sentry to monitor web pages and send alerts. 4. Setting up automatic regression test with Playwright.

### 自述

Having used Javascript for a long time, and it is the language I use for LeetCode. I enjoy reading the book *You Don't Know JS*. Besides that, I am familiar with Typescript. 

For CSS, I love the book *CSS World* and enjoy reading articles on Zhang's blog. 

JLPT N1, IELTS 6.5

My passion is to be a full-stack developer. Hoping to explore the edge of the front-end development.
